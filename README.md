# Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Luis Ross
I'm a electromechanical engineering student from Costa Rica, I like coding in my free time, learning new (and old) languages and technologies, mainly for fun

Interested in the FOSS community, any collaboration proposal will be considered :)

## Interested in
- Desktop apps (GUI, CLI, TUI)
- Static websites
- Operating systems
- Low level programming (microcontrollers)
- Data science (plotting, databases, document generators)
